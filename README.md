#💼 Salary Prediction using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates the implementation of Linear Regression using Scikit-learn to predict employee salaries based on experience (or related features).
The goal is to build a regression model, evaluate its performance, and visualize the results using different plots.

**🧠 Concepts Used**

Linear Regression

Train-Test Split

Model Evaluation (R² Score, MSE)

Data Visualization

🛠️ Technologies & Libraries

🐍 Python

📦 NumPy

📊 Pandas

📂 Dataset Description

The Salary Dataset contains:

Independent Variable (X): Years of Experience

Dependent Variable (Y): Salary

This dataset is used to train a regression model that predicts salary based on experience.

**🔄 Workflow**

Load and explore the dataset

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Split data into training and testing sets

Train the Linear Regression model

Make predictions

Evaluate model performance

Visualize results
